# Module is under construction

The objective of this module is to calculate a measure of information contained within an estimator.
The final code should accept three inputs: 
  1) a characterisation of the dataset one wants to analyse,
  2) a quantity/set of quantities one wants to extract from the dataset, and
  3) a list of estimators.
 With this input, the code should return a ranked list of the estimators with a corresponding 'score' to say which estimator is better suited to the analysis at hand.
